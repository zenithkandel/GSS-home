# Role

You are a senior product designer and frontend UX designer.

# Project Overview

Design a landing page for an **off-grid Emergency Response System** built for remote regions (e.g., rural Nepal) where internet, cellular networks, and power are unreliable.

The system uses **ESP32 + LoRa mesh networking + sensors + basic on-device AI** to detect emergencies and transmit SOS alerts over long distances **without mobile networks or satellites**.

The **web interface is only a monitoring layer**, not the core system. It visualizes data coming from a gateway node for authorities and rescue teams.

# Design Goal

Create a **clean, minimal, sharp UI** that feels **reliable, rugged, and real-world**, not like an AI SaaS product.

---

# Design Constraints

**Do NOT**

- Use purple, blue-neon, or AI-style gradients
- Use soft, bubbly, rounded “AI” UI
- Overcrowd the page

**Do**

- Use sharp edges and clean spacing
- Keep the layout calm and minimal
- Use neutral / earthy colors
- Use illustrations and animations only to explain functionality

---

# Page Structure

1. **Hero Section**
   - Minimal headline
   - Illustration showing a device in hills sending signals to a base station
   - Subtle pulsing signals / heartbeat animation

2. **Working Principle**
   - Animated illustration explaining:
     - Sensor → ESP32 → LoRa mesh → Gateway → Dashboard

3. **Tech Stack**
   - Clean grid of components (ESP32, LoRa, Sensors, Edge AI, Gateway, Web)

4. **Footer**
   - Simple (not included in navbar)

---

# Tech stack

1. HTML, CSS and JS
2. index.html, CSS/style.css, JS/script.js

---

# Navigation

- Extremely minimal
- Only essential links (Hero, Working, Tech)

---

# Tone

Serious, humanitarian, engineering-focused.  
Built for **real emergencies**, not a demo.

# Output

Explain the design concept and layout clearly.  
No code unless asked.
