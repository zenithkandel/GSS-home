Emergency Response System (LoRa + ESP32+AI+sensors)

Global hackathon Team Spark | Global School of Science Hackathon

🚨 The Problem
In rural Nepal—specifically in the remote Himal and Pahad regions—reliable communication is often unavailable. Emergencies like sudden sickness or severe weather can become life-threatening due to:

- Lack of Cellular Coverage: Villagers cannot call for help.
- Delayed Response: It takes too long to get information to rescuers.
- Natural Disasters: Landslides and storms frequently cut off physical access.
- power outage
- mountaineers sos cant be sent as satellite connectivity is expensive and cellular might not be available(delayed rescue misson)

💡 The Solutions
We built a resilient, off-grid Emergency Response System using LoRa Mesh Technology.
This device operates independently of the internet or cellular networks to:

1.  Forecast Health Risks: Basic on-device AI analyzes vitals to predict potential health emergencies.
2.  Send Alerts: Transmits SOS signals over a long-range LoRa mesh network to a central gateway.
3.  Monitor Weather: Local sensors detect dangerous conditions (storms, landslides) to alert the community.

⚙️ How It Works
The system consists of three main layers:

1. The Device (Node)

- Core: ESP32-S3 Cam (N16R8) handles processing and AI tasks.
- Communication: LoRaWAN module sends data over kilometers.
- Naming: Each device is assigned a unique tag (e.g., esp1A, 1B) for easy identification.
- Interface: 2.8" TFT Display shows alerts and status.
- Connectivity: Hosts its own WiFi Access Point (AP) and Web Server at 1.2.3.4 for local configuration.

2. The Network (Mesh Relay)

- Devices form a Mesh Network, hopping signals from one node to another.
- Relay Logic: If a node (e.g., esp1A) has no internet connection, it sends data via LoRa to a neighboring node (e.g., 1B). This chain continues until the data reaches a Gateway Node that updates the central webserver.
- Extends range significantly, covering entire valleys or village clusters.

3. The Backend (Cloud)

- A central gateway syncs critical data to a cloud dashboard.
- Authorities can view real-time incidents and deploy help (e.g., helicopter rescue).

🏔️ Impact in Nepal

- Resilience: Works when phone lines are down.
- Geography-Optimized: Long-range radio penetrates hilly terrain better than 5G/4G.
- Community-First: Villages become self-reliant "Sparks" of connectivity.
